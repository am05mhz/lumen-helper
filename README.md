# lumen-helper

This git is created because of the lack of documentation for Lumen helpers. Instead of its owns documentation, the official documentation suggest to read Laravel's helper page, in which there are many helpers that was omitted in Lumen.

That is why I tried to recreate as many as possible of Laravel's helper for Lumen.

## Installation

    composer config repositories.am05mhz/lumen-helper vcs https://github.com/am05mhz/lumen-helper
    composer require am05mhz/lumen-helper:dev-master
